#  📝 Sign Up Project

## Description

This project is a sign-up form aimed at allowing users to create accounts on a website or application.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Figma for design mockups

## 🤔 Problems Faced 

#### Implementing Design

- The challenge of positioning imagery above divs in the desired layout.
- Finding a suitable solution to style checkbox according to the design requirements.
- Faced difficulty in determining the appropriate placement for the success registration message in the HTML structure. Resolved by placing it within the container that replaced the hidden form.

#### Functionality

- Researched how to restrict the input of phone numbers to accept only numerical digits since the input type attribute wasn't sufficient.
- Encountered an issue with password matching, where the input border color didn't change only when passwords didn't match. The solution involved revising the logic for password validation.
- Needed to implement input validation to check if all fields were filled before enabling form submission.
- Initially implemented password validation only on form submission, leading to unexpected behavior. Realized the need to implement real-time validation.

## 📚 Lessons Learned 

- Enhanced understanding of DOM manipulation techniques.
- Improved grasp of CSS positioning concepts through layout implementation.
- Better comprehension of form creation methodologies.
- Acquired knowledge in design principles and practices.
- Adopted modular function writing approach, creating separate functions for distinct tasks, leading to code that is more readable, understandable, and maintainable.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements 

- Implement more expressive design elements and animations.
- Integrate backend functionality for storing user registration data securely.
- Explore responsive design techniques to optimize the form for various screen sizes.
